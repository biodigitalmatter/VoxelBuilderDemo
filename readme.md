## concept

diffusion mechanism
several layers of the environment effects the agents' behaviour
the agents react to the environment and form it in the same time

## mechanism

the layers of the environment: voxel-like objects (numpy arrays)
agents in the environment: general objects
mechanism: the diffusion
